      "['Bruce Wayne was born to the wealthy doctor Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, who were themselves members of the prestigious Wayne and Kane families of Gotham City, respectively.', \"When he was very young, Bruce's mother Martha was expecting  a second child to be named Thomas Wayne, Jr.\", 'However, because of her intent to found a school for the underprivileged in Gotham, she was targeted by the manipulative Court of Owls, who arranged for her to get into a car accident.', 'She and Bruce survived, but the accident forced Martha into premature labour, and the baby was lost.', \"[2] While on vacation to forget about these events, the Wayne Family butler, Jarvis Pennyworth was killed by one of the Court of Owls' Talons.\", \"A letter he'd written to his son Alfred, warning him away from the beleaguered Wayne family, was never delivered.\", \"As such, Alfred - who had been an actor at the Globe Theatre at the time[3] and a military medic before that, travelled to Gotham City to take up his father's place, serving the Waynes as butler.\", '[4]\\nFollowing his parents deaths, Bruce attempted to commit suicide with a razor blade.', \"However, just before he went through with it, he realized that this wasn't what his parents would want, and it was at that moment Bruce vowed to spend the rest of his life warring on crime.\", '[7]\\nAfter their deaths, Bruce became obsessed with the search for meaning in their loss.', 'He thought perhaps the mythical Court of Owls was responsible, but he never found anything to prove it.', '[8]\\nIn his youth, Bruce attended Gotham Academy.', 'It was there that he dated Julie Madison, but his psychological issues with his parents death ultimately led to the end of their relationship.', 'One day, he was asked by a professor to answer a problem involving a projectile being fired at a target.', 'This triggered Bruce to answer the question by burning the answer in fire on the professors front yard.', '[9] Bruce was later expelled from Gotham Academy and began attending Roxbury Fielding Academy.', \"[10]\\nTroubled by grief, Bruce found that he couldn't function the way he was, so he hired a homeless to pretend to be Alfred to approve of the paper work so that Bruce could erase his memory with electroshock therapy, but chose not to go through with it, and to use his pain as a motivator.\", \"[11] At the age of 18, he used his relationship with Erin McKillen[12] - a daughter of the Irish mob, and with whom he attended Roxbury Academy[13] - to locate Joe Chill, and learned that he had simply needed the money, and there was no deeper meaning to his parents' deaths.\", '[14]\\nFueled by the loss of his parents, Bruce began training in martial arts and sword-fighting.', '[15] After he learned the truth about Joe Chill, Bruce began travelling the world, learning the arts of stunt-driving,[5] invention,[16] and intimidation.', '[17] At the age of 19, he learned how to race cars in life-or-death situations from Brazilian criminal, Don Miguel.', '[5] He was trained in stealth by an unnamed master in the Hida Mountains, in Japan.', '[18] At age 21, Bruce studied the ins and outs of technological gadgetry under the guidance of the brilliant inventor, Sergei Alexandrov.', '[16] He learned how to race cars in life-or-death situations from Brazilian criminal, Don Miguel.', \"[5] At age 24, Bruce was training in Norway, and after 28 hours of fighting a new opponent each hour, after Bruce's determination struck fear into all the Queen's men.\", '[17] Bruce also trained with Chu Chin Li and Tsunetomo, two martial arts masters in the Far East.', 'After this, Bruce travel to Paris, France, to find Henri Ducard, a skilled manhunter.', \"Bruce also became close training partners with Ducard's son, Morgan.\", 'However, when Bruce discovered that Henri killed his targets, he left.', \"This caused Henri to send Morgan after him, but Bruce managed to defeat him, throwing him into Henri's office.\", '[19][20] Near the end of his travels, Bruce went to the Himalayas to train with Shihan Matsuda, who taught him to fight with the katana.', \"He soon struck up a romance with the sword-sharpener's daughter, Mio.\", 'Matsuda warned him against creating personal ties with others, and to embrace his darker side.', \"Matsuda's wife, though encouraged it, and because of Bruce's feelings for her, he inadvertently let an assassin into the Matsuda household.\", \"In the following course of events, Bruce discovered that Mio had been hired by Matsuda's wife to seduce him and then kill Matsuda.\", 'Both women and Matsuda himself were gravely injured, but before he died, Matsuda warned him that death is what would come of fostering close personal relationships.', 'Taking this lesson to heart, and after seven long years of absence, Bruce finally returned to Gotham[21] at the age of 25.', '[22]\\nWith only his mission in mind and no care for his legacy as a Wayne, Bruce moved himself out of Wayne Manor and into a brownstone on Park Row from which he based his early attempts to infiltrate the Red Hood Gang after only six weeks back.', \"[23] Despite trying to remain off the grid, Bruce's uncle Philip Kane had kept tabs on him and had also gained control of Wayne Enterprises in Bruce's absence, hiring strategist Edward Nygma, who advised him to have Bruce killed if he wouldn't play ball.\", \"[5] Philip outed Bruce's return to the media.\", \"When Bruce refused to return to the company while his uncle was selling weapons, Nygma advised Philip to have Bruce killed, and the Red Hood Gang soon attempted just that by blowing up Bruce's brownstone with him inside.\", \"[16] Injured, Bruce crawled back to Wayne Manor and, in his father's study, decided to take on the appearance of a bat.\", '[17]\\nCommissioner Loeb declared the Batman a vigilante criminal as Bruce began investigating a series of murders committed by a disgruntled Waynetech employee, while building a jammer to prevent another EMP attack when power was restored.', \"[25] The ex-employee, Dr. Karl Helfern was challenging enough that Batman allied himself begrudgingly with Jim Gordon, and together they learned that Helfern was the Riddler's pawn.\", '[26] Their plan to defeat both men failed, and the jammer was destroyed such that when the power was restored, the Riddler stole complete control of the power grid, shutting it down and flooding the city.', '[27]\\nIn the following months, the city fell into ruin, with the Riddler nightly challenging the citizens to best him with a riddle in order to earn back civilization.', '[28] Allying with Jim Gordon and Lucius Fox, Batman planned to locate the Riddler by piggybacking his signal during the challenge.', \"[29] The plan failed, but Batman managed to find the Riddler in the place they'd first met, and best him in a battle of wits, both restoring power and saving the city from an inevitable air-strike.\", \"Afterwards, Bruce and Lucius began rebuilding Wayne Enterprises, and Jim Gordon was promoted to Commissioner in Loeb's stead.\", '[30]\\nWhile investigating the appearance of Parademons, Batman encountered Green Lantern for the first time, and the two teamed up.', 'Believing them to be aliens, the pair sought Superman for answers,[31] and he attacked them, thinking they were a threat, prompting Lantern to call on The Flash for help until Superman was convinced of their good intentions.', '[32] Joined by Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Cyborg in fighting off the Parademons attack, the team soon learned that Darkseid of Apokolips was behind the invasion.', \"[33] It was Batman who convinced the heroes to work together as a team, and then secretly travelled to Apokolips in search of a kidnapped Superman, whom he then rescued from Darkseid's torturers.\", 'Upon their return to Earth, they forced Darkseid back to his homeworld, and received praise and recognition.', 'Batman insisted that they remain a team in order to maintain public approval.', '[34]\\nNot long after the Zero Year, Batman had his first confrontation with the resurfaced Red Hood One, now going by the name \"the Joker\".', 'The clown had attempted to poison the Gotham Reservoir, only to be stopped by the Bat.', '[35]\\nHaving created a prototypical version of it during the Zero Year, Jim Gordon took the risk of placing a Bat-Signal on the roof of the GCPD precinct.', '[23] Batman for awhile worked closely with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent in a war on organized crime until Dent was scarred with acid by the criminal Erin McKillen.', '[36]\\nApproximately a year after Zero Year, the Riddler broke out of prison and spurred a war between himself and the Joker, who had lost the ability to laugh, in what would be called \"the War of Jokes and Riddles\".', 'With each side recruiting all the villains they could to fight for them, the city was turned into a war zone for weeks, forcing Batman to choose a side to work with in order for the casualties to stop.', \"Batman begrudgingly chose the Riddler and meticulously took out all of Joker's forces until only the clown was left.\", 'When Batman predictably betrayed the Riddler, Nygma surrendered and revealed that he orchestrated the entire war in an attempt to solve the riddle of how to make the Joker laugh again.', \"Furious Riddler caused the deaths of so many innocent people for something so trivial, Batman lost control and attempted to stab Nygma in the face with a kitchen knife, only to be stopped by the Joker himself - this event becoming one of Batman's greatest failures.\", '[37]\\nAround this time, Bruce took in young Dick Grayson after his parents were murdered by Tony Zucco.', \"Without knowing Bruce's secret, Dick would sneak out at night, hunting Zucco, and the Batman would be there to protect him every time.\", \"Eventually, he allowed Dick to see the Batcave, and Dick revealed that he'd already deduced his warden's dual identity.\", 'With the common goal of justice, the pair began fighting crime as Batman and Robin.', \"[38]\\nWithin another year, Barbara Gordon had caught Batman's attention and was recruited into his crusade as Batgirl.\", 'Barbara only acted as a hero for less than a year before retiring to focus on her studies.', \"Despite that, her father's position still made her a target, and she was shot by The Joker and remained paralyzed for three years.\", \"[39] Following Barbara's injury, Dick decided to quit being Robin and moved on to a new identity for himself as Nightwing.\", 'In an effort to take control of Gotham City, Bane ran Batman ragged, and then broke his back.', \"[40] Some time later, Ra's al Ghul attempted to eradicate the population of Gotham City using the Ebola Gulf-A Virus, and was thwarted by the Batman.\", '[41]\\nSometime after that, Batman caught orphan Jason Todd trying to steal prescription drugs from Dr. Leslie Thompkins.', 'Believing that Todd had the potential to turn over a new leaf, Wayne offered him the vacant position of Robin and, when he accepted, trained him for months.', 'However, soon after Jason had become active as a vigilante, he was lured into chasing a woman he believed to be his mother to the middle east - a setup by the Joker - and killed before Batman could save him.', \"[42]\\nHaving encountered Ra's al Ghul and the League of Assassins some time ago, and fallen in love with his daughter Talia,[44] Bruce was surprised years later when Talia came to Gotham and introduced him to his son, Damian, whom she had grown in a lab at an accelerated rate and trained to lead the League from birth.\", 'She intended for Bruce to train their son in the ways she could not, and in the hope of curbing his homicidal tendencies, he took on the boy as Robin to keep a close eye on him.', '[45]\\nNot long after taking on Damian, though, Bruce was seemingly killed by Darkseid,[46] having in fact been sent back in time.', 'While Nightwing eventually took on the role of Batman in his stead, training Damian as Robin,[47] Bruce fought his way forward through time.', '[48] and upon his return, announced that he had been privately funding the Batman, and declared the creation of Batman Incorporated.', \"While Bruce Wayne revealed plans to revolutionize the city of Gotham, the GCPD uncovered a body with ties to the legend of the Court of Owls and a warning of an attempt against Bruce's life.\", '[49] Batman believed the Court of Owls were just a legend, but after taking a meeting with an interested business partner in Lincoln March, Bruce was nearly killed by an assassin dressed like an owl in Wayne Tower.', '[50] While investigating the assassination attempt, Batman became trapped in an underground labyrinth where the very much real Court of Owls held him for eight days and attempted to drive him insane.', 'Despite this, he managed to break his way into an underground portion of the Gotham River[51] and was found and revived from cardiac arrest by Harper Row.', '[52]\\nAfter tracking the Court of Owls back to their hideout, Batman found all its members dead - poisoned by their food.', 'Following clues to the ruins of a mental hospital, Batman learned that Lincoln March, his former business partner, was behind the betrayal within the Court.', \"March believed himself to be Bruce's Wayne's younger brother, Thomas Wayne, Jr., [2] and that, when he was a boy, he had been taken in by the Court and raised to believe Martha Wayne was his mother.\", 'March grew to resent Bruce and took the role of King of the Owls to win control of the city for himself and to kill Bruce.', 'In their encounter, Lincoln March escaped, leading Bruce to assume the Court of Owls would one day return.', \"[4]\\nAt that same time, a murderous vigilante called NoBody began attempting to win Bruce's son's loyalty away from him, encouraging him to break with Batman's no-kill policy.\", 'He soon realized that this man was Morgan Ducard, with whom he had trained in man-hunting some years ago.', '[54] When Damian declined to join him, NoBody turned on him, and Batman was forced to save him.', \"In the resulting battle, it was Damian who made the final blow and killed NoBody,[55] causing his father to worry if he'd ever be able to train him not to perpetuate the cycle of violence.\", '[56]\\nHaving waited for nearly a year in hiding, the Joker reappeared at the GCPD Headquarters and killed several officers to signal his return to Batman, and to retrieve his face from the evidence locker, which he had cut off and left behind before his disappearance.', \"[57] The Joker then threatened to recreate one of his first recorded murders with Gotham's Mayor, but he killed all of the guards outside the Mayor's office instead, leaving disturbing frowns instead of the trademark Joker smiles on their faces.\", \"Seeing a pattern in Joker's twisted recreations of past crimes, Batman went to the A.C.E.\", 'Chemical building, where a distraction provided by a reluctant Harley Quinn allowed the Joker to go to Wayne Manor and attack Alfred.', \"[58]\\nBruce's allies compelled him to admit that after his second encounter with the Joker, he had found one of the Joker's cards in the Batcave, but had never believed that his identity was compromised.\", 'Insisting that his allies remain safe in the cave, Batman followed a lead to Arkham Asylum, where he learned that the Joker had taken over without being noticed.', '[60] There, Batman discovered that the Joker has renovated and rearranged the building into a kind of castle, of which Batman was King, and he was Jester.', 'The only way to find out what happened to his kidnapped allies, whom the Joker had captured in the interim, was to go along with the skit the madman put together and electrocute himself in his hot-wired \"throne\".', '[61]\\nBatman woke at a dinner table in the Batcave surrounded by his allies, all with bandaged faces.', 'Removing the lids from the dinner platters in front of them, the Joker revealed each of their faces.', 'After discovering that the bandages and severed faces were a fake-out, Batman chased down the Joker, who chose to fall into a chasm rather than allow Batman to reveal either of their identities, and spoil his fantasy.', \"Despite everyone being alive and well, Bruce's insistence on keeping secrets the Joker's taunts drove a wedge between he and his family.\", '[62]\\nBorrowing the Suit of Sorrows to face Talia and the Heretic, Batman transformed himself into a bat-creature[67] After Batman pummeled the Heretic and discovered with disgust that he was a clone of Damian, the Heretic escaped Batman only to be executed by Talia for failing to follow her orders.', '[68]\\nBatman and Talia came to a final confrontation in the Batcave, with the woman forcing him to choose between taking her life or giving his life along with his city - with the trick being that she had already poisoned him.', \"In a bid for Batman's life, Wingman offered the Oroboro device Talia sought, as a distraction, as the headmistress of Spyral shot her in the head, freeing the city of Leviathan's grasp.\", 'In the aftermath, Bruce Wayne was arrested, but charges were dropped.', \"Upon his return to the manor, he and Alfred discovered that the corpses of both Damian and Talia had been dug up and stolen by Ra's al Ghul.\", '[69]\\nWhile attempting to recover from his grief, Batman was faced with the threat of The Wrath - a cop-killing arms dealer who had a vendetta against the GCPD, but soon defeated him.', \"[73]\\nIn the hopes of ridding the world of evil, Pandora tried to have members of the Justice League open Pandora's Box for her, believing that their virtuousness would prevent the calamity that occurred when she opened it.\", '[74] Unbeknownst to her, a secret organization was using her as a pawn in a ploy to have the three Justice Leagues come into conflict.', \"The leagues split up in order to discover their own solutions to the puzzle of Pandora's Box.\", '[75] Batman headed the team who believed that there was a scientific explanation for the box and its apparent affect on Superman.', '[76] Upon their eventual convergence upon the box, the Leagues discovered that it was a doorway to another world, from which the Crime Syndicate emerged, and imprisoned the majority of the Justice Leagues within the Firestorm Matrix.', \"[77]\\nOnly Batman and Catwoman evaded the Syndicate's imprisonment and, after bringing a critically injured Cyborg to S.T.A.R.\", \"Labs for repair, learned that Nightwing's secret identity had been revealed by the Syndicate.\", 'Together, Batman and Catwoman decided to seek him out and rescue him from imprisonment.', '[78] While searching for more resources in a Wayne Enterprises storage facility, Bruce and Selina encountered Lex Luthor and his followers, who were also prepared to combat the Syndicate.', \"Their confusion at Batman's survival was smothered by the arrival of Power Ring.\", 'Hoping to counter him, Batman donned a Sinestro Corps Ring, only to have it removed and destroyed.', \"[79] Fortunately, Sinestro, himself was drawn by the ring's energy, and killed Power Ring, suggesting that Batman join the Sinestro Corps, if ever he had the opportunity to wear a yellow ring again.\", \"[80]\\nAfter being forced to follow Lex Luthor's lead, begrudgingly, the pair discovered Nightwing trapped within an Apokoliptian device called the Murder Machine, deep within the ruins of the Justice League Satellite.\", 'Dick warned, though, that the device he was strapped to was synced with his heart rate, such that they would either blow up with the device, or they would have to kill him.', \"Despite Dick's begging, Bruce refused to leave him.\", 'More decisively, Lex chose to suffocate Dick until his heart stopped, buying them the time to get him out of the machine and then resuscitate him.', '[81] He had, in fact, given Dick a pill that would stop his heart temporarily, requiring a shot of adrenaline before brain death.', 'Once Dick was revived, he, Batman, and Catwoman escaped to seek out the remainder of the Justice League.', \"With a plan to use Wonder Woman's Lasso of Truth to pull the League out of the Firestorm Matrix and Steve Trevor out of action though, Martian Manhunter appointed Batman to be the one to wield the Lasso, because of his connection to Wonder Woman.\", 'Using it, he saved the imprisoned heroes while Lex and his allies defeated the Crime Syndicate.', 'Afterwards, despite his closeness with Catwoman, Batman insisted that they could not start a romance together, and returned home with Dick.', 'Having been presumed dead, Batman offered him an opportunity to take advantage of his compromised identity by joining Spyral.', 'In the meantime, Gotham had become a war zone between the inmates of Arkham Asylum and the inmates of Blackgate Penitentiary the latter of whom were led by Bane.', '[82] As victor, Bane claimed the mantle of the Bat for himself, requiring Batman to wrest it back from him.', \"When Bane was safely imprisoned in Arkham, Bruce Wayne promised funds to improve the asylum's security and to the city's restoration.\", '[83]\\nSoon after taking control of the city again, Batman experienced a blast from the past when Erin McKillen returned to Gotham to meet with the other crime families to take back the city from the \"freaks\".', \"McKillen's return caused a conflict with Two-Face, who received his famous scars from McKillen.\", 'After Batman managed to stop the two from killing each other, McKillen was arrested, her plan thwarted, and Two-Face, disillusioned with his life, shot himself through the head.', \"[84]\\nWhen a mysterious malefactor came to Gotham City with a yearlong plot to destroy Batman's life, phase one of the mastermind's scheme involved framing Commissioner Gordon for the murders of a derailed train car full of people, which Batman swore to exonerate him for.\", \"Simultaneously, the mastermind invited former Gotham mob boss Carmine Falcone back from his refuge in Hong Kong to initiate a gang war with the Penguin, again to add another conflict on Batman's hands.\", \"However, despite the corrupt replacement Commissioner Forbes' interference, Batman, with the help of the GCPD, captured the two gang leaders, seemingly putting their war to an end.\", '[85]\\nAnother part of the plot to wear down Batman was to resurrect the evil cult leader Deacon Blackfire in Arkham Asylum, but this plan was (mostly) foiled by Batwing and Jim Corrigan.', 'However, the building of Arkham Asylum was destroyed in the process, setting its inmates loose in Gotham.', \"[87] When Batman finally managed to catch Hush, it was too late - Batman had been distracted so long that the real conductor had totally cleaned out all of Batman's secret gadget caches and sold them to his enemies.\", \"[88] While still searching for who was behind this complicated conspiracy, Batman set his sights on Ra's al Ghul who, also, was another red herring.\", '[89]\\nFollowing Arkham Asylum\\'s destruction, Batman allowed Wayne Manor to be the temporary home to its inmates, and even went into the new asylum undercover as the dead man \"Jack Shaw\" to investigate a series of murders.', 'Despite solving the mystery, and having the opportunity to get his home back, Bruce let the city keep the Manor until they were able to erect a permanent replacement in the wake of the recent attack on Gotham.', \"[92]\\nBatman's arrival on Apokolips roused even Darkseid himself, who challenged the determined father.\", \"Managing to get to Damian's body, Batman thrust the charged Chaos Crystal shard into Damian's chest and restored him.\", \"[96] Escaping Darkseid's world through a Boom Tube, it was then that they discovered Damian's resurrection from the Chaos Crystal had given him super-human abilities.\", '[97] which wore off after some time.', '[98]\\nWhile recovering from an attack by the Scarecrow, Batman was attacked by a Jokerized Justice League, signaling the Joker had returned again at last.', '[99] After subduing the Justice League, Batman then learned that the newest doctor at Arkham Asylum - Eric Border - had actually been the Joker in disguise all along.', 'The madman, shedding his disguise in front of the hero, activated a toxin in Gotham that rendered all of its citizens Jokerized.', '[100]\\nLooking for a cure for the new strain of toxin, Batman sought patient zero at the hospital for an antibody, but discovered that patient zero was Joe Chill, the murderer of his parents.', 'After hearing many rumors from friends and enemies alike, Batman began to believe that the Joker could possibly be immortal thanks to an exposure to the element Dionesium, a component found in Lazarus Pits.', \"[101]\\nBy the time Batman had discovered the fabled pool of Dionesium that had been in the Joker's system, the villain had found him and attacked him in the tunnels.\", \"They fought brutally until both of them were near death, and as the cavern collapsed around them, Bruce held the Joker back from the healing pool, forcing him to acknowledge that he had not been around for centuries as he'd claimed.\", 'Together, Batman and the Joker died in that cave.', \"When Batman's dead body was discovered in the rubble of the collapsed cavern, he suddenly came awake, apparently revived by the Dionesium within the cavern's pit.\", \"Alfred discovered that the revival had had the profound effect of remaking Bruce's brain from scratch - with no memories of his past life.\", 'Alfred told him all that he felt necessary, but withheld the fact that Bruce had been the Batman.', 'Bruce - a new man - had not wanted to know anyway.', '[102] He later reunited with Julie Madison and began working with her at the Lucius Fox Center for Gotham Youth.', \"[103]\\nAfter seeing firsthand just how

mysteriously disintegrated by a being he claimed was God.', \"[123] In an attempt to discover who had killed Reverse-Flash and was manipulating the timestream, Batman and the Flash used the Cosmic

metals required to open the portal to the Dark Multiverse.', 'They exposed him to the final metal, Batmanium, which transformed Bruce into a doorway, allowing Barbatos and his army of Dark Knights to enter.', \"[130]\\nWhile his Justice League teammates fought the Dark Knights, Bruce's mind was trapped in the nightmarish Dark Multiverse.\", \"There, Barbatos told him that he first saw Batman when

his most unlikely ally, the Joker.', 'The Over-Monitor told the Justice League of the power of the Tenth Metal, Element X - the most powerful metal of all.', 'Through channeling the tiny amount of Element X present in every living human being, the heroes were able to restore the Multiverse to its normal state, however in the process they shattered the Source Wall, the wall surrounding the Multiverse.', 'As the League prepared to face any and all threats this could cause, Bruce presented his plans for a new Hall of Justice.', '[133]\\nFollowing his engagement, Batman and Catwoman

them up on an offer.', 'Years ago, Batman and Wonder Woman discovered The Gentle Man, a man who endlessly protected Earth from the invasion of creatures from another realm.', 'They offered him the chance to take his place for a day and he had decided to take them up on their offer.', 'The Gentle Man failed to tell the heroes that time passed differently in this realm; while they spent what felt like years in battle, mere hours had passed on Earth.', '[136] While alone for so many years, Batman and Wonder Woman almost gave in to a romantic attraction, but refrained out of love for their partners.', 'Catwoman forced The Gentle Man to swap places with Batman and Wonder Woman once more.', \"[137]\\nIn an attempt to instil peace across the planet and protect Earth from destruction at
